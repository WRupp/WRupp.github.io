                    <h3>GenAI Platform</h3>
                    <p>
                        Designed and implemented an AI platform for model deployment and fine-tuning. 
                        Developed end-to-end machine learning pipelines using Kubeflow, Argo Workflows, and Tekton.
                        Deployed model serving solutions with KServe and MLflow.

                    <h3>ECG annotation and patient risk assesment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Developed a deep learning system for automatic diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions using 12-lead ECG signals.
                        It processes live ECG data to detect anomalies and captures cardiac events. By integrating patient data and clinical metadata, it provides personalized, accurate risk assessments.
                        Implemented a continuous training pipeline, to enable learning of rare events.

                    <h3>Predictive Maintenance for Hydro-Power and Oil Pump Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        Developed machine learning models for anomaly detection in hydro-power generators, analyzing sensor data (e.g., stator temperature, fluid flow, and shaft vibration). Implemented adaptive thresholding for fault detection in oil pumps and created asset health monitoring dashboards. Collaborated with maintenance engineers and domain experts to define and track key business metrics.
